things to do {
	optimize the online and offline friend checking to fetch with a list instead of a making a request for each friend
	make it detect disconnect from twilio itself instead of onbeforeunload becaues the pop up is annoying
}


doing right now {
	friends{
	add animations and update the call options div and add loading when joining
	}
}
